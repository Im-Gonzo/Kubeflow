# Kubeflow + MLFlow

This project aims to provide a comprehensive guide and practical implementation for setting up a robust MLOps environment. 

By leveraging the power of Kubeflow for Kubernetes resource orchestration and MLFlow for experiment tracking, you'll be able to streamline your machine learning workflow, from development to deployment.

The primary goals of this project are:

1. **Simplify MLOps Setup**: Provide step-by-step instructions for setting up a Kubernetes cluster with K3s, installing Kubeflow, and integrating MLFlow for end-to-end experiment tracking.

2. **Implement ML Algorithm**: Showcase the implementation of a machine learning algorithm from scratch, serving as a practical example for developing and tracking ML models.

3. **Promote Best Practices**: Demonstrate best practices for version control, reproducibility, and collaboration in machine learning projects, ensuring a smooth transition from research to production.

By following this project, you'll gain hands-on experience in building a production-ready MLOps environment, enabling you to efficiently manage and deploy machine learning models at scale.
